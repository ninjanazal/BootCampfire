# BootCampfire

Welcome to BootCampfire! This is the Spring Boot project that's more springy than a kangaroo on a pogo stick and packed with more MongoDB and Redis goodness than you can shake a stick at. It's your go-to service for account management, registration, login, and session management.
This is also only a study project :)

## Features

- **Account Management**: Handle user accounts like a superhero.
- **Registration & Login**: Sign up and sign in with the grace of a ninja.
- **Session Management**: Track sessions like a master detective.

## Quick Start

Just run the Docker Compose file and let the magic happen. No complicated setup, no fuss. It's so easy, even your cat could do it (if your cat could code).

Get ready to spring into action with BootCampfire - where backend services meet fun!
